Take FREE INSTANT account-to-account payments and refunds on your store.

== Description ==

[Super Payments](https://www.superpayments.com) is the world’s first payment provider to offer WooCommerce businesses fee-free payments & customer refunds. No catches, no hidden charges.

You can also opt in for Cash Rewards, a proportion of the sale price you’re willing to offer as money off a customer’s next purchase, to drive:

* Higher conversion rate
* Higher retention and frequency
* Higher average order value
* Higher lifetime value

You only fund the Cash Reward if your customer returns to you and buys again.

Super Payments wants businesses and shoppers to keep more of their money. We’re making it possible by eliminating the high fees on the internet charged by payments companies so that merchants can pass on these extra savings to their customers. 

The Super Payments Gateway extension for WooCommerce allows you to take free payments from your customers either via a card (Credit/Debit) or open banking (paid from your customer’s banking app, straight to your business bank account). 

* Payments and refunds are free forever.
* Super Payments uses both card and account-to-account payments, diversifying the payment options for your customers at checkout.
* A simple and painless 3 click payment process, supporting both mobile & desktop.
* Super Payments provide free weekly settlements and the option to increase payouts to daily.
* Super Payments provide instant full or partial refunds for an exceptional customer experience.
